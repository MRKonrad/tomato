We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

\subsection*{Our Development Process}

We use Git\-Hub to sync code to and from our internal repository. We'll use Git\-Hub to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

\subsection*{Issues}

We use Git\-Hub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

\subsection*{Report bugs using Github's \href{https://github.com/MRKonrad/tomato/issues}{\tt issues}}

We use Git\-Hub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by \mbox{[}opening a new issue\mbox{]}(); it's that easy!

\subsection*{Pull Requests}

We actively welcome your pull requests.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Fork the repo and create your branch from {\ttfamily master}.
\item If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
\item If you've changed A\-P\-Is, update the documentation.
\item Ensure the test suite passes.
\item Make sure your code lints.
\item Issue that pull request!
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Any contributions you make will be under the M\-I\-T Software License}

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same \href{http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/}{\tt M\-I\-T License} that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

\subsection*{Coding style}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Write code compatible with C++98
\item Use underscore ({\ttfamily \-\_\-variable}) in the name of a class member variable.
\item C++98 does not allow me to use constructor delegation. Using methods like {\ttfamily set\-All\-Pointers\-To\-Null()} to make up for it.
\item Order of methods in a class definition\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item functional (calculation, helpers etc)
\item getters/setters
\item disp()
\item constructors/destructors
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item In {\bfseries copy constructors} copy primitive types, set all pointers to zero.
\end{DoxyItemize}
