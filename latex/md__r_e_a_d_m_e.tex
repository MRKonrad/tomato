A library to calculate parametric maps in M\-R\-I. It contains Sh\-M\-O\-L\-L\-I implementation as in \href{https://jcmr-online.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1532-429X-12-69}{\tt this article}.

\subsection*{Documentation}

{\bfseries Documentation} in doxygen can be found \href{https://mrkonrad.github.io/OxShmolli2/html}{\tt here}.

\subsection*{Ox\-Shmolli2 and Numerical Recipes}

{\bfseries Important} Original Sh\-M\-O\-L\-L\-I (and based on it Ox\-Shmolli2) uses code based on Numerical Recipes book. Due to Numerical Recipes licence I cannot share this part of the code online. Please contact me if you would like to use this part of the code. To make up for this limitation we provide a number of alternative fitting procedures.

\section*{Software Requirements Specification}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Calculate Sh\-M\-O\-L\-L\-I with exactly the same results as these from the previous implementation.
\item A\-P\-I for easily switching between different\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item map calculation algorithms,
\item fitting algorithm,
\item model function and corresponding energy function.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Compatibility with\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item main operating systems (Windows, Mac\-O\-S, Linux),
\item C++98 (to include the library in older code).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Handling D\-I\-C\-O\-M files.
\item Fast calculation.
\item Easily interfaced to calculation environments M\-A\-T\-L\-A\-B, I\-D\-L and Python.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\section*{Coding style}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Underscore ({\ttfamily \-\_\-variable}) means a class member variable.
\item C++98 does not allow me to use constructor delegation. I am using methods like {\ttfamily set\-All\-Pointers\-To\-Null()} to make up for it.
\item Order of methods in a class definition\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item functional (calculation, helpers etc)
\item getters/setters
\item disp()
\item constructors/destructors
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item In {\bfseries copy constructors} copy primitive types, set all pointers to zero.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{Notes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Continuous integration} was tested \href{https://github.com/MRKonrad/ContinousIntegrationPlayground}{\tt in this repo}.
\item {\bfseries Gitmodules}\-: after {\ttfamily git clone} run {\ttfamily git submodule update -\/-\/init -\/-\/recursive} to get the submodules code.
\item It would be nice to follow https\-://github.com/isocpp/\-Cpp\-Core\-Guidelines/blob/master/\-Cpp\-Core\-Guidelines.\-md \char`\"{}\-Cpp\-Core\-Guidlines\char`\"{} as far as C++98 allows.
